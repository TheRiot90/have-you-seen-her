Read aloud in a deep, resonant, and somber tone, embodying an ancient chronicler recounting a dark and inevitable fairytale. The delivery should begin with a slow, warm pace to establish the love of Annie's parents, but steadily introduce a sense of foreboding as hardship and sickness arrive. Linger on moments of tragedy with deliberate pauses, allowing the weight of grief to feel palpable before building the tension through the final confrontation. Escalate the narration from a tight whisper to a powerful, awe-filled delivery that mirrors the chaotic eruption of Annie's magic, and conclude by letting the voice fall into a quiet, chilling whisper that conveys a profound and lingering sadness, solidifying the story's tragic vow.

Narrator: On the very edge of the world, where the land itself was an enemy, a single hearth-fire dared to burn. It was here Gregori the Gray and the witch Amoline built a life—not of conquest, but of quiet defiance. A life about to be graced by a new, brighter flame.

Amoline knew the old tales of the great shadow bears, guardians of the primal wood. And so, into a vessel of cloth and thread, she poured more than love. She wove a piece of her own soul into every stitch, a living ember meant to guard her unborn daughter.

They named her Annie. But the land seemed to resent her warmth. A creeping sickness, cold as the grave, stole into their home. As the child's fever raged, a desperate Amoline made a final bargain, not with gods, but with the storm outside. She walked into the blizzard to draw the cold into herself… and never returned.

Narrator: The fever was gone. But so was Amoline. In the silence that followed, Annie’s young heart forged its own truth, a truth harder than iron: her mother had not left her. Her mother was now her guardian. Her mother was Tibbers.

Grief carves a hollow space that lesser things rush to fill. Gregori’s new wife, Leanna, saw not a grieving child, but an omen. A girl who cheated death and spoke only to a toy. The whispers of the other settlers confirmed her fears… unnatural, they said. Cursed.

Narrator: Tragedy has a way of finding the same door twice. A flash of childish anger… a slip on a mossy stone… a life swept away by the river's current. It was an accident. But in a heart poisoned by fear, there are no accidents. Only blame.

Leanna: Always this… this thing. A shadow of the witch who bore you. You took my daughter from me… and still you cling to your mother's curse. She left it for you. And now… it will burn.

Narrator: In that moment, as the bear was cast into the roaring fireplace, a dam of grief, rage, and a terrible, slumbering power did not just break. It detonated. The very air turned to ash as a monstrous, shadowy form clawed its way out of the hearth, a roar of pure agony and fury shaking the foundations of the world.

Narrator: That day, she lost the final echo of her past. Her home. Her family. All that remained was the quiet hum of cooling embers… and a promise, whispered into scorched fur. He was her protector. He was her only friend. He was her mother. And she would burn the world to ashes before she ever let anyone take him away from her again.

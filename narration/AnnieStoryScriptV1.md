Read aloud in a deep, resonant, and somber tone, embodying an ancient chronicler recounting a dark and inevitable fairytale. The delivery should begin with a slow, warm pace to establish the love of Annie's parents, but steadily introduce a sense of foreboding as hardship and sickness arrive. Linger on moments of tragedy with deliberate pauses, allowing the weight of grief to feel palpable before building the tension through the final confrontation. Escalate the narration from a tight whisper to a powerful, awe-filled delivery that mirrors the chaotic eruption of Annie's magic, and conclude by letting the voice fall into a quiet, chilling whisper that conveys a profound and lingering sadness, solidifying the story's tragic vow.

Narrator: In the harsh, untamed borderlands north of Noxus, a sliver of warmth and love flickered into existence. Gregori the Gray and his wife, Amoline, had sought refuge from the capital's political strife, choosing instead to build a life on the frontier. It was a simple life, a good life. And it was about to be blessed with the arrival of their first child.

Amoline, captivated by the local tales of great shadow bears, protectors of the forest, poured all her love and a touch of her own unique magic into a toy crafted in their image. A guardian for their unborn daughter.

They named her Annie. And from her first breath, she and the bear, who she lovingly called Tibbers, were inseparable. He was her constant companion, her silent confidant, the keeper of all her childhood secrets.

Narrator: But the untamed lands were not without their hardships. A sickness swept through their small home, gripping both Annie and her father. As Annie’s fever burned hotter, Amoline grew desperate.

In a selfless act of love, Amoline ventured into the storm to find a cure, leaving a piece of her own essence, her own protective spirit, within the threads of the small bear. She never returned.

Narrator: Gregori awoke the next morning to find his daughter’s fever had broken. But his beloved Amoline was gone. For Annie, in her innocent heart, a simple truth took root: her mother was not gone. Her mother was with her, always. Her mother was Tibbers.

Life moved on, as it often does. Gregori, in his grief, sought to give Annie a new family. But Leanna could not understand the bond between the girl and her stuffed bear. She saw only a strange fixation, a refusal to let go of the past. The whispers of the other settlers, their fear of the strange child with a fiery temper, only fueled her apprehension.

Narrator: Tragedy, once again, cast its shadow upon their lives. Daisy’s death was an accident, a cruel twist of fate. But in her grief, Leanna found someone to blame.

Leanna: This… this is your fault! This… thing!

Annie: Give. Him. Back.

Narrator: In that moment, a dam of emotion burst within the small child. Grief, rage, and a terrifying, untamed power erupted from deep within her. The last tangible piece of her mother was threatened, and Annie would not, could not, let it be taken away.

Narrator: That day, Annie lost everything. Her home. Her family. All that remained was the scorched earth, the lingering scent of ash, and her beloved Tibbers. He was more than just a toy. He was her protector. He was her only friend. He was her mother. And she would never let anyone take him away from her again.
